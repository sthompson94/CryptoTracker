# Crypto Tracker!

[Deployed Link](https://bit-ticker.herokuapp.com/).

## Track Cryptocurrency Prices Live

This app gets info from the third-party API, CoinMarketCap.com, then displays it to the screen using cards built with React.
The information will update every 30 seconds.

## Plans to Improve

* Add a backend with MySQL to save crypto prices periodically.
* Use a charting npm package to graph prices based on an MySQL database
* Display specific cryptocurrencies instead of just the most popular four, implement a serch function
* (Huge stretch) add user accounts and allow users to save which cryptos they wish to track

## Technologies Used

* React.js
* Bootstrap CSS
* Express.js
* Axios.js
* Heroku;
